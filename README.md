This is for everybody who likes to write! Take whatever part of the prompt feels most exciting and doable to you. Try a prompt like "Write about a friendship where one person's out the door and the other has no idea" and see where it takes you. Our goal is for it to feel good, fun, and inspiring.

## What Is Creative Juice?

Creating feels awesome. And, it takes courage and inspiration! Creative blocks are real and make it easy to give up. Begone, creative blocks! The vision of Creative Juice is to inspire and support creativity through community. Together, we will develop a habit of daily creative practice, which changes how we see ourselves and the world around us in beautiful and surprising ways. We hope you'll join our community!

## How Does It Work?

It's super simple. You get one email a day with a prompt. Reply with whatever you write, and you'll get to see the pieces other writers created for that prompt (likewise, they'd get to see yours)! All the writing is anonymous.
